# Overwatch-Auto-Loot-Box-Opener
A simple AHK script to open the loot box in Overwatch. 

When you open the script via AHK, a GUI interface will pop up to allow you to input the number of loot boxes you want to open. 
After entering and confirming the number, the script will wait for 5 seconds to allow you to return to Overwatch and open the loot box menu (see the attached screenshot). 
Then it will automatically open all the loot boxes without any human intervene. After all is done a tray message will pop up to notify the user. 

Feel free to change the time delay between each step.
